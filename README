This is an AVL tree. It is made up of a tree and a node class. The tree itself
is made up of the nodes. There are also drivers that test this tree each with
different data types since this is a polymorphic generic container. Templates
make that passible. THe drivers implement file reading specified by the command
line to test the tree. Multiple test files are provided, each with different 
data types.Because this is an AVL tree, unlike a regular binary tree, there is a
balancing feature that executes when a defined balance threshold has been 
surpassed. This tree has an insert, find, and remove function. There is a well 
formated print function of the tree and all theindividual nodes in the tree. 
Post order deletion is implemented to prevent memory leaks. This tree also 
features width of each node, levels of each node, and the depth of the tree 
itself.
